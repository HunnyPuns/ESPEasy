#Pretty basic. This is just a file of rules that I use with ESP Easy.


#Send temperature data to Nagios via a passive service check to NRDP
#The sendToHTTP has a bunch of variables encapsulated in < >. Change those to suit your environment.
#Towards the end of sendToHTTP are temperature variables for the ESP chip. I use this for basic temp monitoring,
#but oviously if you're using something else, like a humidity sensor, change as needed.
#The passive check result includes perf data, so if you're using Nagios XI or PNP4Nagios, you'll get performance graphs
